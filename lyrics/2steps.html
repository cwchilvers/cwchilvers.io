        <h2>2 :ＳＴＥＰＳ</h2>
        <p>
            Wake up, the day slips by<br>
            Another day slips through my hands<br>
            Oh, why can't life just slow down?<br>
            Can't have a moment to appreciate<br>
            What's 'round<br><br>

            But no, I have to go<br>
            Have to keep on moving<br>
            'Til my body says no — oh, oh<br>
            When the curtain falls<br>
            And it's time to end the show<br><br>

            Two steps, oh, I'm going to break<br>
            Another<br>
            Two steps that I'm going to take<br>
            I guess I'll<br>
            Fall...<br>
            Gonna take a leap and risk it all...<br><br>

            Relax, just take a breath<br>
            Just try to stay calm<br>
            You got this — don't think wrong<br>
            It's in your palm<br>
            This moment's yours<br>
            Pull together, you must be strong...<br><br>

            With all that's wrong<br>
            With steady hands, you will carry on...<br>
            It won't be long<br>
            When you put in the effort, you'll find that song<br>
            Keep hold, and you'll find that very song<br>
            With time, you will find your song<br><br>

            Two steps, oh, I'm going to break<br>
            Another<br>
            Two steps that I'm going to take<br>
            I know I'll<br>
            Fall...<br>
            Gonna take this leap<br>
            Gonna take it all...<br>
        </p>
